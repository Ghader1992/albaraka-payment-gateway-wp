**Important Security Note:**
The callback from Al Baraka needs to be secured. This plugin includes placeholders for hash/signature verification. Ensure you or your developer implement this security measure based on Al Baraka's specific technical documentation to prevent fraudulent transaction updates.

## Callback / Webhook URL

The default callback URL that Al Baraka will use to send payment status updates is:
`yourdomain.com/wc-api/wc_gateway_albaraka_callback/`

(Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name). You typically need to provide this URL to Al Baraka Bank during your merchant account setup.
